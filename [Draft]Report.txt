// Confidence Band Report draft. Further details and explanations to be added.

The following results were obtained by training an LSTM model on the stock price data of Google, taken from SP500 dataset. 

The input is the 2-dimensional(Opening and Closing prices). The training data shape is (944, 2) and it was split into 4 non-overlapping intervals of block size 236 each. 

The blocks were shuffled to generate all permutations and for each permutation the model was trained and the resulting prediction was stored. Finally, the 95% confidence interval of predictions at each time step was calculated and a confidence band was calculated.
